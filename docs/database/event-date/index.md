# Event Date

In Uranus, the `event_date` table plays a pivotal role in managing the scheduling and timing of events within the platform. It captures crucial details such as the specific date and time of each occurrence, enabling precise coordination and calendar integration. Each event_date record is linked to its parent event, allowing multiple dates or sessions to be associated with a single event, thus supporting recurring or multi-day formats.

Beyond basic scheduling, the event_date table interacts closely with other entities like venues, spaces, and organizers to reflect the location and responsible parties for each session. This interconnected structure ensures that every event occurrence is accurately contextualized within the broader event ecosystem, facilitating clear communication and resource allocation.

By modularizing date and time information in the event_date table, Uranus allows for flexible event planning, improved user experience, and seamless integration with ticketing, reservations, and notifications — all critical for managing complex event lifecycles effectively.
