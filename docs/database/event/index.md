# Event

In Uranus, the `event` table serves as the foundational element for managing core event information across the platform. It consolidates key details such as organizational ownership, venue assignment, age restrictions, descriptive content, and related metadata that define the identity and parameters of each event.

This table acts as the central hub linking organizers, spaces, and additional event-related entities, enabling comprehensive management and presentation of events. By separating event-level data from scheduling and session-specific details, Uranus supports flexible workflows for event creation, modification, and display.

With the `event` table as the backbone of event data, the platform ensures consistent, accurate, and rich information delivery that enhances both administrative control and user-facing experiences — a critical component for orchestrating events of varying complexity and scope.
