# Integration

The Uranus platform is designed with openness and flexibility in mind, making it suitable for a wide range of integration scenarios across platforms, websites, and tools.

## CMS Plugins

Uranus can be integrated into popular content management systems through custom or community-built plugins. These allow event data to be displayed and managed directly within the CMS interface.

- **WordPress:** Custom plugins can fetch event data via the API to render listings, calendars, or detail pages.
- **TYPO3:** Integration with the TypoScript configuration allows embedding and managing event information.
- **Other CMS:** Systems like Drupal, Joomla, or Headless CMS platforms can consume Uranus data via its JSON API.


## API in Custom Development

Uranus exposes a RESTful API that developers can use in their own applications or tools. This enables:

- **Custom Frontends:** Build your own UI tailored to your audience.
- **Data Analysis:** Export event, venue, or organizer data for statistical analysis or reporting using tools like Python, R, or Excel.
- **Raw Data Output:** Retrieve structured data in JSON format for further processing or synchronization.


## Integration in Portals and Community Platforms

Uranus fits well into cultural portals, city event calendars, and community-driven platforms. Use cases include:

- Aggregating events from multiple organizers
- Highlighting featured or recurring events
- Showing event data in map-based views or timelines


## Additional Integration Scenarios
- **Mobile Apps:** Pull event and space data directly into native iOS/Android apps.
- **Digital Signage:** Use API to display up-to-date schedules on physical info displays.
- **Search Engines & Aggregators:** Feed structured event data (e.g., via Schema.org) for better indexing and visibility.
- **Ticketing Systems:** Link events with external ticketing or registration tools.
