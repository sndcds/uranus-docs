# New Users and Access Rights

When a new user account is created in Uranus, it initially has limited permissions. By default, new users can:

- View selected public data records
- Create a new organizer entry, which serves as the foundational reference for adding further data such as venues, events, or spaces

This structure ensures that all content is connected to an accountable entity (an organizer) and maintains data integrity across the platform.

If a user wishes to work with data that is already associated with an existing organizer, they can request permission to do so. Authorized members of that organization — or system administrators — can grant the necessary roles and permissions. Once assigned, the user can create, edit, or manage event-related content on behalf of the organization, depending on their access level.

This approach provides a balance between open participation and controlled collaboration, ensuring that data remains consistent, traceable, and well-maintained.
