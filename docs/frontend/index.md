# Frontend Interface

The Uranus frontend provides a user-friendly interface for managing event data and related information. It serves as the main access point for users to interact with the system based on their assigned roles and permissions.

Key features of the frontend include:

- **User Login & Profile Management**  
Authenticated users can log in to the system, manage their personal settings, and update profile preferences such as display name or preferred language.
- **Dashboard Overview**  
After logging in, users are presented with a personalized dashboard that offers an overview of their current data — such as created events, associated venues, or affiliated organizations — and provides quick access to editing or creating new entries.
- **Role-Based Access Control**  
Access to data and functions is governed by a flexible role system. Depending on their assigned role, users can:
- **View, create, edit, or delete records**
     - e.g., events, venues, spaces
     - Manage their own content or that of linked organizers, venues, spaces, or events
     - Administer user privileges for others, if permitted
- **Import and export of data**

This interface enables both casual users and administrators to work efficiently with the structured data model of Uranus, ensuring clarity, security, and accountability in collaborative environments.
