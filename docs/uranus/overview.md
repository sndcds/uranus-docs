# Uranus

**Uranus is a flexible, open-source event management platform designed to organize, schedule, and promote cultural activities. It offers a structured database of organizers, venues, spaces, and events — accessible via a robust API for seamless integration and customization. Community contributions, feedback, and collaboration are warmly welcomed.**


## Focus on Nonprofits

Uranus is purpose-built to support non-profit organizations, with a strong focus on smaller and niche groups that often lack the digital infrastructure or visibility they need. Its mission is to empower these organizations to present themselves clearly, communicate their goals and structure, and share their events and activities effectively.

Whether it’s organizing local initiatives, promoting cultural traditions, or creating safe spaces for learning and exchange, Uranus provides a user-friendly environment designed to amplify the voices of those who make a real impact in their communities.


## Committed to Values

Uranus stands for an inclusive and respectful society. It supports cultural diversity, minority representation, gender equality, and sustainable development. By giving grassroots organizations the tools to thrive, Uranus contributes to a more connected, equitable, and resilient cultural ecosystem.


## Digitally Mapping and Sharing the Event Landscape

Uranus aims to provide a detailed and flexible representation of the event landscape to make it easier to create, manage, publish, and share high-quality event data.

It enables organizers to describe their events in a structured, standardized, and high-quality manner. The resulting data can be used in their own online systems and made available to external applications and platforms via open interfaces.

Beyond that, Uranus provides a technical foundation for the development of new digital services that support organizers, coordinators, and audiences in planning, communication, and discovering events.


## Structured Event Data

The database models events along with their organizational and spatial context in a structured and detailed way. It captures not only the descriptive content of the event itself, but also important information about the venue — such as room identifiers or accessibility features — that can be essential for interested attendees. Providing comprehensive visitor information, including accessibility details, is crucial for creating an inclusive and welcoming environment.


## Data Integration via Web Interfaces

The database is accessed through a clearly defined application programming interface (API). Access is handled via standardized HTTP endpoints (URLs), which are controlled by parameters that determine what data is retrieved or submitted to the system.


## Target Audiences

Uranus addresses a wide range of user groups. Organizers from cultural, educational, or civic sectors can capture and manage their events in a structured format. At the same time, interested individuals benefit from targeted search options — for example, by location, audience, or accessibility. Institutions such as municipalities, cultural portals, or media platforms can integrate the data via interfaces for their own purposes. Furthermore, the structured dataset allows journalists and cultural professionals to quickly access relevant and reliable information about the event landscape.


## Open Source and Licensing

Uranus is developed as an open-source project with a strong focus on transparency, collaboration, and long-term sustainability. It is released under a very permissive open license — allowing individuals, institutions, and developers to:

- **Reuse** the codebase for their own projects
- **Modify** and adapt the software to suit specific needs
- **Redistribute** it freely, with or without changes

This open model encourages integration into existing systems, custom extensions, and community-driven improvements.

Whether you’re building a cultural portal, integrating with a CMS, or developing tools for internal use — Uranus offers the freedom to create without licensing restrictions. Contributions, bug reports, feature suggestions, and forks are welcome via the official repository.
