# Language Support

**Uranus manages data in multiple languages to support diverse user needs.**


## Fallback Language

To ensure smooth user experience even when some content is unavailable in the requested language, Uranus implements a fallback language mechanism. This means that if specific information is missing in the preferred language, the system automatically provides data from a designated fallback language. This approach reduces strict dependency on complete localization and allows for flexible, multilingual content delivery.


## Key Properties

Uranus especially supports multilingual handling for key properties such as event types, genre information, and tags. These elements are stored and managed in multiple languages to accurately reflect cultural and linguistic differences.


## Event Information

Specific event information such as titles and descriptive texts can optionally be created and maintained in multiple languages. This multilingual support allows event organizers to provide localized content tailored to different audiences, improving accessibility and engagement.
