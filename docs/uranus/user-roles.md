# User Roles

**User roles in Uranus define the permissions and responsibilities of each user within the system. They are essential for maintaining security, clarity of responsibilities, and efficient collaboration in teams of different sizes and structures.**

By assigning roles such as Admin, Manager, or Booker, organizations can ensure that users only access the features and data relevant to their tasks. This helps prevent unintended changes, streamlines workflows, and allows larger teams to work in parallel without interference. Whether someone is managing venues, curating event content, or simply monitoring system insights — user roles ensure everyone has the right level of access.


**Admin** – Has full permissions across all areas including management of users, events, spaces, content, and insights. Intended for system administrators or project leads.

**Manager** – Also has comprehensive permissions, identical to Admin, and can perform all administrative, editorial, and operational tasks. Suitable for trusted users overseeing content and operations.

**Assistent** – Can view and edit basic content, such as organizers, but cannot manage users or delete entities. Ideal for support staff or interns handling content entry and updates.

**Viewer** – Read-only access to all data. Cannot make any changes. Best suited for auditors or stakeholders who need visibility without editing rights.

**Space Coordinator** – Can manage spaces and associated events, including adding, editing, and deleting them. Cannot access user or organizer settings. Useful for technical or operational roles managing local venue schedules.

**Booker** – Focused on event scheduling and management: can create, modify, and manage event dates. Cannot change organizers or general system settings. Suitable for roles responsible for booking and programming.

**Insight Viewer** – Can access analytics or reporting features only. No editing rights. Designed for those who evaluate usage or engagement data.

**Proofreader** – Has limited editorial access, primarily to review and publish content (e.g., releasing events). Cannot modify structures or users. Useful for editors approving final content before publication.
