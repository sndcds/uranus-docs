# Core Entities of the Uranus Database

**The Uranus system is built around a set of core entities — each representing a specific layer in the event and venue management hierarchy. These building blocks form the foundation for all data operations, from event creation to public presentation and reporting.**

Together, these entities form a flexible and modular system that supports: Multi-day and recurring events, complex venue structures, delegated editorial permissions, consistent data for public platforms and exports.

This layered architecture makes it easy to create, manage, and publish events without overcomplicating the data model.
