# Organizer

**The organizer represents a person, group, association, company, or institution that is responsible for planning, hosting, or coordinating events within the Uranus system. It is a central entity in the data model and acts as the foundational reference point for managing related information such as venues, spaces, and events.**


Each organizer entry contains both administrative and descriptive information, including:

- **Name and description** for clear identification
- **Contact details** such as email, phone number, and website
- **Address information** to provide location context and support geospatial features
- **Organizational attributes** such as legal form, non-profit status, and parent organization relationships

The organizer structure enables:

- **Ownership and grouping of content:** All events, venues, and spaces must be associated with an organizer, ensuring accountability and traceability.
- **Delegation and permissions:** Roles and permissions are often managed at the organizer level, allowing different users to collaborate on the same organizational data.
- **Hierarchical relationships:** Organizers can be linked to a holding (parent) organizer, supporting federated structures like umbrella organizations with multiple subgroups.

In short, the organizer defines who is behind a set of activities, and provides the administrative and legal context for event-related data. It is the starting point for new users who wish to contribute content to the Uranus platform.


## Who Can Create Organizers?

In the Uranus system, any registered user has the ability to create a new organizer. This **open approach** ensures that individuals, initiatives, associations, institutions, or businesses — regardless of their size or professional background — can begin using Uranus to manage and publish event-related data.

Creating an organizer is typically the first step for new users, as it provides the foundation for:

- Adding venues and spaces
- Creating events
- Managing contact and organizational information
- Assigning user roles and permissions within the organization

Once an organizer is created, the user who created it is automatically associated with it and may be granted administrative rights, depending on the system’s configuration. These rights can later be extended to other users for collaborative editing and management.

This structure supports both decentralized participation and accountable content management, allowing Uranus to scale across communities while maintaining structured and reliable data.
