# Event Contributor

**An event contributor is a person, group, or organization that plays a meaningful role in the creation, presentation, or execution of an event—but is not necessarily the main organizer.**


**Common types of event contributors:**

- Artists or performers (e.g., a musician in a concert)
- Speakers or presenters (e.g., at a talk or workshop)
- Curators (for exhibitions)
- Collaborating institutions (e.g., co-hosting organizations)
- Technicians or stage designers (in technical roles)

In data terms:

If you’re modeling events (e.g., in a database like Uranus), an event contributor:

- Might be linked to one or more events.
- Can have a role or function (e.g., “pianist”, “director”, “moderator”).
- Is distinct from the organizer, who manages the event overall.
